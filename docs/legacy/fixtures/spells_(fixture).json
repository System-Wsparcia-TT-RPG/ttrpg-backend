You might issue a command other than one described here. If you do so, the DM determines how the target behaves. If the target can\u2019t follow your command, the spell ends.\n\nApproach: The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route, Ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you.\nDrop: The target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its turn.\nFlee: The target spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest available means.\nGrovel: The target falls prone and then ends its turn.\nHalt: The target doesn't move and takes no Actions. A flying creature stays aloft, provided that it is able to do so. If it must move to stay aloft, it flies the minimum distance needed to remain in the air.",
